# **CAL Sync**

## Background
I grew tired of manually entering my assignments into my Google Calendar, so I built this to speed up the process. Now, instead of spending hours typing, I can spend that time doing what I really love: staring at my screen, wondering why I didnâ€™t automate this sooner!

## Tech
Currently, I am using beautiful soup to scrape my CS course websites and use the Google Calendar/Tasks API to send the info directly to my calendar. I then incorporated this web scrapping script into a beautiful web app built with CSS, HTML, and Flask.
